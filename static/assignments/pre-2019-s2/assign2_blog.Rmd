```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE, 
                      message = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE, 
                      error = FALSE,
                      fig.align = "center")

```
 
In this assignment, the focus was on tidying data from the Census TableBuilder tool, in order to explore the association between education, gender and age.

The most surprising thing I learned is that there are more females doing Bachelors degrees, and also post-graduate degrees.

There were several approaches to making plots of these variables.
