- filter
- select
- mutate
- group_by
- summarise
- arrange
- count, tally

### *FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE NOTES* 

- Open your ETC1010 `Rproj`
- Download the `lecture2b_tidydata.Rmd` file from the class web site
- You should already have the data sets that you need, from last class

## Side-note: Package system

We have been loading the `tidyverse` package. Its actually a suite of packages, and you can learn more about the individual packages at https://www.tidyverse.org. You could load each individually.

Because so many people contribute packages to R, it is a blessing and a curse. The best techniques are available, but there can be conflicts between function names. When you load tidyverse it prints a great summary of conflicts that it knows about, between its functions and others.

```{r message=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

For example, there is a `filter` function in the `stats` package that comes with the R distribution. This can cause confusion when you want to use the filter function in `dplyr` (part of tidyverse). To be sure the function you use is the one you want to use, you can prefix it with the package name, `dplyr::filter()`.

## Example: french fries

![](images/french_fries.png)

- Load the data
- Gather into long form

```{r}
load("data/french_fries.rda")
ff_long <- french_fries %>% 
  gather(type, rating, -subject, -time, -treatment, -rep) %>%
  mutate(type=as.factor(type))
```

### The story of the french fries data....

This was an actual experiment in Food Sciences at Iowa State University. The goal was to find out if some cheaper oil options could be used to make hot chips: that people would not be able to distinguish the difference between chips fried in the new oils relative to those fried in the current market leader.

Twelve tasters were recruited to sample two chips from each batch, over a period of ten weeks. The same oil was kept for a period of 10 weeks! May be a bit gross by the end!

This data set was brought to R by Hadley Wickham, and was one of the problems that inspired the thinking about tidy data and the plyr tools. 

## filter: choose observations

Filter records for subject 10.

```{r}
ff_long_subj10 <- ff_long %>%
  filter(subject == 10)
ff_long_subj10
```

`==` does a logical equals check. This works nicely for characters or factors but not for numerical data.

To filter you need to do some comparison to find the subset of observations you are interested in. For example:

- `subject != 10` finds rows corresponding to all subjects except subject 10
- `x > 10` find all rows where variable `x` has values bigger than 10
- `x >= 10` find all rows where variable `x` has values bigger than *or equal to* 10
- `class %in% c("A", "B")` finds all records where variable `class` is either A or B
- `!is.na(y)` finds all the records that *DO NOT* have a missing value for variable `y`

### Your turn

Filter the french fries data to have:

- only week 1
- weeks 1-4 only
- oil type 1 (oil type is called treatment)
- oil types 1 and 3 but not 2

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ff_long %>%
  filter(week == 1)
ff_long %>%
  filter(week < 5)
ff_long %>%
  filter(treatment == 1)
ff_long %>%
  filter(week != 2)
```


## select

`select` chooses which variables to keep in the data set. It is useful when there are a lot of variables but you only need some of them for an analysis. 

```{r}
tb <- read_csv("data/TB_notifications_2018-03-18.csv") %>%
  select(country, year, starts_with("new_sp_")) 
tb %>% top_n(20)
```

- Generally a comma separated list of the variables, by name. 
- You can use text-matching of the names like `starts_with`, `ends_with()`, `contains()`, `matches()`, `num_range()`, `one_of()` or `everything()`
- You can use `:` to choose variables in order of the columns, eg `select(df, V4:V6)`
- And you can use it to NOT select some variables by prefixing with `-`

### Your turn

For the french fries data, use select to do these tasks:

- choose time, treatment and rep
- choose subject through to rating
- drop subject

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ff_long %>% 
  select(time, treatment, rep)
ff_long %>%
  select(subject:rating)
ff_long %>%
  select(-subject)
```

## mutate

`mutate` is used to create a new variable. 

```{r}
load("data/pisa_au.rda")
pisa_au <- pisa_au %>%
  select(PV1MATH:PV10MATH)
pisa_au %>%
  mutate(math = (PV1MATH+PV2MATH+PV3MATH)/3)
```

### Your turn

- Compute a standised math score, by subtracting the mean from PV1MATH and dividing by the standard deviation
- For the french fries data compute a new variable called lrating by taking a log of the rating

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
pisa_au %>%
  mutate(PV1MATH = (PV1MATH-mean(PV1MATH))/sd(PV1MATH))
ff_long %>%
  mutate(lrating=log10(rating))
```

## summarise and group_by

`summarise` generates a summary of a variable. It is most useful when working on subsets of the data, and `group_by` can automate this.

```{r}
ff_long %>% 
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE))
```

### Your turn

- Compute the average rating by subject
- Compute the average rancid rating per week

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ff_long %>% 
  group_by(subject) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE))
ff_long %>% 
  filter(type == "rancid") %>%
  group_by(time) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE))
```

## arrange

`arrange` orders a table by a given variable. Its usful for display of results, primarily.

```{r}
ff_long %>% 
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(rating)
```

### Your turn

- Arrange the average rating by type in decreasing order
- Arrange the average subject rating in order lowest to highest.

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
ff_long %>% 
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(rating))
ff_long %>% 
  group_by(subject) %>%
  summarise(rating = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(rating)
```

## count, tally

These are convenience functions to compute numbers in different categories.

```{r}
ff_long %>% count(type, sort=TRUE)
```

## Putting it together to problem solve

### Are ratings similar?

```{r}
ff_long %>% 
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(m = mean(rating, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd = sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(desc(m))
```

The scales of the ratings are quite different. Mostly the chips are rated highly on potato'y, but low on grassy. 

Make a picture too!

```{r}
ff_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=type, y=rating)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

### Are reps like each other

```{r}
ff_long %>% 
  spread(rep, rating) %>%
  summarise(r=cor(`1`, `2`, use="complete.obs"))
```

Make a picture, too!

```{r}
ff_long %>% 
  spread(rep, rating) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + geom_point()
```

This data is poor quality - the replicates do not look like each other!

### Replicates by rating type

```{r}
ff_long %>% 
  spread(rep, rating) %>%
  group_by(type) %>%
  summarise(r=cor(`1`, `2`, use="complete.obs"))
```

Make a picture, to!

```{r}
ff_long %>% 
  spread(rep, rating) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=`1`, y=`2`)) + 
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~type, ncol=5)
```

Potato'y and buttery have better replication than the other scales, but there is still a lot of variation from rep 1 to 2.

## Lab exercise

This question is about the 2015 PISA results. The data is downloaded from [http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2015database/](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2015database/). The SPSS format "Student questionnaire data file (419MB)" is downloaded and processed using this code, to extract results for Australia:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(haven)
pisa_2015 <- read_sav(file.choose())
pisa_au <- pisa_2015 %>% filter(CNT == "AUS")
save(pisa_au, file="pisa_au.rda")
```

**You don't need to do this**, because the Australia data is extracted and saved for you. Your task is to answer these questions about Australia. At times it may be helpful to examine the data dictionary, which is provided as an excel file (you can also download this directly from the OECD PISA site too).

A large amount of pre-processing is done on the data, as performed by this code:

```{r}
load("data/pisa_au.rda")
pisa_au <- pisa_au %>% mutate(state=as.character(substr(STRATUM, 4, 5)),
                schtype_yr=as.character(substr(STRATUM, 6, 7))) %>%
  mutate(state=recode(state, "01"="ACT", "02"="NSW", "03"="VIC",
       "04"="QLD", "05"="SA", "06"="WA", "07"="TAS", "08"="NT")) %>%
  mutate(schtype_yr=recode(schtype_yr,
            "01"="Catholic_Y10", "02"="Catholic_noY10",
            "03"="Gov_Y10", "04"="Gov_noY10",
            "05"="Ind_Y10", "06"="Ind_noY10",
            "07"="Catholic_Y10", "08"="Catholic_noY10",
            "09"="Gov_Y10", "10"="Gov_noY10",
            "11"="Ind_Y10", "12"="Ind_noY10",
            "13"="Catholic_Y10", "14"="Catholic_noY10",
            "15"="Gov_Y10", "16"="Gov_noY10",
            "17"="Ind_Y10", "18"="Ind_noY10",
            "19"="Catholic_Y10", "20"="Catholic_noY10",
            "21"="Gov_Y10", "22"="Gov_noY10",
            "23"="Ind_Y10", "24"="Ind_noY10",
            "25"="Catholic_Y10", "26"="Catholic_noY10",
            "27"="Gov_Y10", "28"="Gov_noY10",
            "29"="Ind_Y10", "30"="Ind_noY10",
            "31"="Catholic_Y10", "32"="Catholic_noY10",
            "33"="Gov_Y10", "34"="Gov_noY10",
            "35"="Ind_Y10", "36"="Ind_noY10",
            "37"="Catholic_Y10", "38"="Catholic_noY10",
            "39"="Gov_Y10", "40"="Gov_noY10",
            "41"="Ind_Y10", "42"="Ind_noY10",
            "43"="Catholic_Y10", "44"="Catholic_noY10",
            "45"="Gov_Y10", "46"="Gov_noY10",
            "47"="Ind_Y10", "48"="Ind_noY10")) %>%

```

a. Explain how the STRATUM variable is processed to create three new variables state, schtype and yr.
b. Compute the average of math scores by state. Which state does best, on average, on math? (You should use the stuweight variable to compute a weighted average. This is survey data, and the weights indicate how representative that individual is of the population.)
c. Compute the difference in average male and female math scores by state. Which state has the smallest average gender difference?
d. Does test anxiety have an effect math score? (Use the variable `anxtest`, and a simple regression model to answer this question.)
e. Explain what the `rename` operation is doing.
f. Come up with two more questions as a group, based on the data description. Do the wrangling to answer these questions. Discuss these with a tutor.

Now you are ready to complete the lab quiz.
