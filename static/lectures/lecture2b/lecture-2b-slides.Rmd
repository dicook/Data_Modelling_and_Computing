# Many R packages

.huge[
- A blessing & a curse! 
- So many packages available, it can make it hard to choose!
- Many of the packages are designed to solve a specific problem
- The tidyverse is designed to work with many other packages following a consistent philosophy
- What this means is that you shouldn't notice it!
]


???

Extra reading:

We have been loading the `tidyverse` package. Its actually a suite of packages, and you can learn more about the individual packages at https://www.tidyverse.org. You could load each individually.

Because so many people contribute packages to R, it is a blessing and a curse. 

???

The best techniques are available, but there can be conflicts between function names. When you load tidyverse it prints a great summary of conflicts that it knows about, between its functions and others.


For example, there is a `filter` function in the `stats` package that comes with the R distribution. This can cause confusion when you want to use the filter function in `dplyr` (part of tidyverse). To be sure the function you use is the one you want to use, you can prefix it with the package name, `dplyr::filter()`.

This was an actual experiment in Food Sciences at Iowa State University. The goal was to find out if some cheaper oil options could be used to make hot chips: that people would not be able to distinguish the difference between chips fried in the new oils relative to those fried in the current market leader.

Twelve tasters were recruited to sample two chips from each batch, over a period of ten weeks. The same oil was kept for a period of 10 weeks! May be a bit gross by the end!

This data set was brought to R by Hadley Wickham, and was one of the problems that inspired the thinking about tidy data and the plyr tools.
