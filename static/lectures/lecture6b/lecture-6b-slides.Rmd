# File Paths and organising yourself

.huge[
- It's important when you start working on your own machine that you understand _file storage hygiene_. 
- It helps prevent unexpected problems and makes you more productive 
- You'll spend less time fighting against strange file paths. 
- Not sure what a file path is? We'll explain that as well.

# A Mantra: When you start a new project \- Open a new RStudio project

.huge[
- This section is heavily influenced by [Jenny Bryan's great blog post on project based workflows.](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)
- Sometimes this is the first line of an R Script or R markdown file.

```r
setwd("c:/really/long/file/path/to/this/directory)
```
- What do you think the `setwd` code does?
]

---
class: bg-main1

# What does `setwd()` do?

.huge[
- "set my working directory to this specific working directory".

- It means that you can read in data and other things like this:

```r
data <- read_csv("data/mydata.csv")
```

- Instead of

```r
data <- read_csv("c:/really/long/file/path/to/this/directory/data/mydata.csv")
```
]

---
class: bg-main1

# What does `setwd()` do?

.huge[
- This has the effect of **making the file paths work in your file**
- This is a problem because, among other things, using `setwd()` like this:
  -  Has 0% chance of working on someone else's machine (**this includes you in >6 months**)
  - Your file is not self-contained and portable. (Think: _"What if this folder moved to /Downloads, or onto another machine?"_)
- To get this to work, you need to hand edit the file path to your machine. 
- This is painful. And when you do this all the time, it gets old, fast.

class: bg-main1

# What even is a file path?
  
.huge[
- The machine-readable directions to where files on your computer live.
- So, this file path:

```
/Users/njtierney/rmd4sci-materials/demo-gapminder.Rmd
```

Describes the location of the file "demo-gapminder.Rmd". 
]


---
class: bg-main1

# What even is a file path?

.huge[
We could visualise the path

```
/Users/njtierney/rmd4sci-materials/demo-gapminder.Rmd
```

as:

```
users
  â””â”€â”€ njtierney
        â””â”€â”€  rmd4sci-materials
               â””â”€â”€ demo-gapminder.Rmd
```
]

---
class: bg-main1

.huge[
- To read in the `gapminder.csv` file, you might need to write code like this:

```r
gapminder <- read_csv("/Users/njtierney/Desktop/rmd4sci-materials/data/gapminder.csv")
```
 
This is a problem, because this is not portable code.
]

.huge[
It has ZERO chance of working on someone else's machine
]

---
class: bg-main1

.huge[
If you have an RStudio project file inside the `rmd4sci-materials` folder, you can instead write the following:

```r
gapminder <- read_csv("data/gapminder.csv")
```
]

# Your Turn

.vlarge[
- What folders are above the `health.csv` file in the following given file path? 

`"/Users/miles/etc1010/week1/data/health.csv"`

- What would be the result of using the following code in `demo-gapminder.Rmd`, and then using the code, and then moving this to another location, say inside your C drive?

```r
setwd("Downloads/etc1010/week1/week1.Rmd)
```

# Rstudio projects help keep related work together in the same place.


.huge[

* Keep all your files together
* Set the working directory to the project directory
* Starts a new session of R
* Restore previously edited files into the editor tabs
* Restore other rstudio settings
* Allow for multiple R projects open at the same time.

# Rstudio projects help keep you sane, because:

.huge[
* Projects are independent. 
* You can work on different projects at the same time. 
* Objects & functions created in one project won't impact another.  
* You can refer to your data and other projects in a consistent way.

.huge[
And finally, the big one

**RStudio projects help resolve file path problems**, because they automatically set the working directory to the location of the rstudio project.

---
class: bg-main1

# A Bit more on file paths

---
class: bg-main1

# The "here" package

.huge[
- RStudio projects help resolve file path problems
- In some cases you might have many folders in your r project. To help navigate them appropriately, you can use the `here` package to provide the full path directory, in a compact way.

```{r show-here}
here::here("exercise")
```

]
---
class: bg-main1

# The `here` package

.huge[
```{r show-here-exercise}
here::here("exercise", "lecture-6b-exercise.Rmd")
```

]

---
class: bg-main1

.huge[

```r
here::here("exercise", "lecture-6b-exercise.Rmd")
```

You can read the above `here` code as:

> In the folder `exercise`, there is a file called `lecture-6b-exercise.Rmd`. Can you please give me the full path to that file? 

]


---
class: bg-main1

# The `here` package

.huge[
This is really handy for a few reasons:

1. It makes file paths _completely_ portable
1. Rmarkdown documents have a special way of looking for files, this helps eliminate file path pain.
1. If you decide to not use RStudio projects, you have code that will work on _any machine_

# Why functions?

.huge[
- Automate common tasks in a power powerful and general way than copy-and-pasting:
    - Give a functions an evocative name that makes code easier to understand.
    - As requirements change, **you only need to update code in one place, instead of many**.
    - You eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).

# aside: `list`s as an idea: first...vectors

.huge[
- `c()` creates a **vector** of one type
- e.g., `x <- c(1, 2, 3, "A")` contains:

# aside: `list`s as an idea: second...lists

#> [[4]]
#> [1] "x"
```
]

---

# aside: `list`s as an idea: second...lists
