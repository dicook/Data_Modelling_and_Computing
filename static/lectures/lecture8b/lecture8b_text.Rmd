# Sentiment analysis

## Course web site

This is a link to the course web site, in case you need to go back and forth between tutorial and web materials: [http://dmac.dicook.org](http://dmac.dicook.org)

## Overview

Sentiment analysis tags words or phrases with an emotion, and summarises these, often as the positive or negative state, over a body of text. 

Examples of use are:

- Examining effect of emotional state in twitter posts
- Determining public reactions to government policy, or new product releases
- Trying to make money in the stock market by modeling social media posts on listed companies
- Evaluating product reviews on Amazon, restaurants on zomato, or travel options on TripAdvisor

## Lexicons

The `tidytext` package has a lexicon of sentiments, based on four major sources: [AFINN](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010), [bing](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), [Loughran](https://sraf.nd.edu/textual-analysis/resources/#LM%20Sentiment%20Word%20Lists), [nrc](http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm)

```{r}
sentiments %>% count(lexicon, sort=TRUE)
```

```{r}
sentiments
```

What emotion do these words elicit in you?

- summer
- hot chips
- hug
- lose
- stolen
- smile

### Different sources

- The `nrc` lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion (“yes”/“no”) into categories of positive, negative, anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. 
- The `bing` lexicon categorizes words in a binary fashion into positive and negative categories. 
- The `AFINN` lexicon assigns words with a score that runs between -5 and 5, with negative scores indicating negative sentiment and positive scores indicating positive sentiment.

```{r}
get_sentiments("afinn")
```

```{r words, echo=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What score does the word `hug` get in the AFINN lexicon",
    answer("-2"),
    answer("-1"),
    answer("0"),
    answer("1"),
    answer("2", correct=TRUE)),
  question("Hug is considered a positive word accoridng to the bing lexicon",
    answer("True", correct=TRUE),
    answer("False")),
  question("According to the `nrc` lexicon what emotion does the word `hug` induce?",
    answer("fun"),
    answer("nice"),
    answer("fear"),
    answer("trust", correct=TRUE))
  )
```

## Sentiment analysis

Once you have a bag of words, you need to join the sentiments dictionary to the words data. Particularly the lexicon `nrc` has multiple tags per word, so you may need to use an "inner_join". `inner_join()` returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.

The `janeaustenr` package contains the full texts for Jane Austen's 6 completed novels, Sense and Sensibility", "Pride and Prejudice", "Mansfield Park", "Emma", "Northanger Abbey", and "Persuasion", ready for text analysis. 

```{r}
library(janeaustenr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

tidy_books <- austen_books() %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
         chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]", 
                                                 ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```

Let's look at the most frequent joyful words in "Emma". 

```{r}
nrc_joy <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment == "joy")

tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%
  inner_join(nrc_joy) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

"Good" is the most common joyful word, followed by "young", "friend", "hope". All make sense until you see "found". Is found a joyful word?

### Your turn

- What are the most common "anger" words used in Emma?
- What are the most common "surprise" words used in Emma?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nrc_anger <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment == "anger")

tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%
  inner_join(nrc_anger) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

nrc_surprise <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment == "surprise")

tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%
  inner_join(nrc_surprise) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

### Comparing lexicons

All of the lexicons have a measure of positive or negative. We can tag the words in Emma by each lexicon, and see if they agree. 

```{r}
nrc_pn <- get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative"))

emma_nrc <- tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%
  inner_join(nrc_pn)
emma_bing <- tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) 
emma_afinn <- tidy_books %>%
  filter(book == "Emma") %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) 
emma_nrc %>% count(sentiment) %>% mutate(n/sum(n))
emma_bing %>% count(sentiment) %>% mutate(n/sum(n))
emma_afinn %>% mutate(sentiment = ifelse(score>0, "positive", "negative")) %>% count(sentiment) %>% mutate(n/sum(n))

```

### Your turn

- Using your choice of lexicon (nrc, bing, or afinn) compute the proportion of positive words in each of Austen's books.
- Which book is the most positive? negative?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
pos_nrc <- tidy_books %>%
  group_by(???) %>%
  ???_join(nrc_pn) %>% 
  ???(sentiment) %>% 
  mutate(pos = ???/sum(n)) %>%
  filter(sentiment == ???)
pos_nrc %>% arrange(desc(???))
```

## Example: Simpsons

Data from the popular animated TV series, The Simpsons, has been made available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data/data). 

- `simpsons_script_lines.csv`: Contains the text spoken during each episode (including details about which character said it and where)
- `simpsons_characters.csv`: Contains character names and a character id

```{r}
scripts <- read_csv("data/simpsons_script_lines.csv")
chs <- read_csv("data/simpsons_characters.csv")
sc <- left_join(scripts, chs, by = c("character_id" = "id") )
sc %>% count(name, sort=TRUE)
```

#### Pre-process the text

```{r}
sc %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, spoken_words) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(!is.na(word)) %>%
  mutate(word = factor(word, levels = rev(unique(word)))) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = word, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity', colour="white") +
  labs(x = '', y = 'count', 
       title = 'Top 20 words') +
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_bw()
```

#### Tag the words with sentiments

Using AFINN words will be tagged on a negative to positive scale of -1 to 5.

```{r}
sc_word <- sc %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, spoken_words) %>%
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  count(name, word) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(!is.na(word))
sc_s <- sc_word %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments("afinn"), by = "word")
```

#### Examine characters

```{r}
sc_s %>% group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(m=mean(score)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(m))
```

Oh, maybe we want to only focus on the main characters.

```{r}
keep <- sc %>% count(name, sort=TRUE) %>%
  filter(!is.na(name)) %>%
  filter(n > 999)
sc_s %>% filter(name %in% keep$name) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(m=mean(score)) %>% 
  arrange(m)
```

#### Your turn

1. Bart Simpson is featured at various ages. How has the sentiment of his words changed over his life?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sc %>% ???(name, sort=TRUE) %>%
  ???(grepl("Bart", name)) %>% print(n=50)
bart_names <- c("Bart Simpson", "Baby Bart", 
                "1-Year-Old Bart", "2-Year-Old Bart", 
                "5-Year-Old Bart", "80-Year-Old Bart")
bart <- sc %>% filter(name %in% ???)
bart_word <- bart %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, ???) %>%
  ???_join(stop_words) %>%
  ???(name, word) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(!is.na(word))
bart_s <- bart_word %>% 
  ???_join(get_sentiments("afinn"), by = "word")
bart_s %>% group_by(???) %>% 
  ???(m=mean(score)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(m))
```

2. Repeat the sentiment analysis with the NRC lexicon. What character is the most "angry"? "joyful"?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
sc_s <- sc_word %>% 
  ???_join(get_sentiments("nrc"), by = "word")
sc_s %>% filter(name %in% ???) %>% 
  group_by(///) %>% 
  summarise(angry = sum(n[sentiment==???]/sum(n))) %>%
  arrange(desc(angry))
```

## Example: AFL Finals tweets

The `rtweet` package allows you to pull tweets from the archive. It gives only the last 6-9 days worth of data. You need to have a twitter account, and you need to create an app (its really basic) in order to pull twitter data. The instructions that come from this package (https://rtweet.info) are pretty simple to follow.

Given that it is AFL final week, I thought it might be interesting to look at tweets that use the hashtag "#AFLFinals". Once you have a developer account, this is as simple as 

```
afl <- search_tweets(
  "#AFLFinals", n = 20000, include_rts = FALSE
)
```

I have provide the data collected in the last year's AFL finals. You can load it with:

```{r}
load("data/afl_twitter.rda")
afl
```

### Your turn

- When was the final played last year?
- What is the range of dates of this data?
- Who is the most frequent tweeter using this hashtag?
- Are there some days that have more tweets than others?
- Are there some hours of the day that are more common tweet times?

### Sentiment analysis

We need to break the text of each tweet into words, tag the words with sentiments, and make a cumulative score for each tweet.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
afl_sentiment <- afl %>% 
  group_by(???) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, ???) %>%
  ???_join(get_sentiments("afinn")) %>%
  ???(sentiment = mean(score, na.rm=T)) 
afl_sentiment <- afl %>% select(status_id, screen_name, created_at, text) %>% 
  left_join(afl_sentiment, by=c(???))
afl_sentiment %>% group_by(???) %>%
  ???(s = mean(sentiment, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% arrange(desc(s))
afl_sentiment %>% mutate(day = ???)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=day, y=sentiment)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se=FALSE)
afl_sentiment %>% filter(screen_name == ???) %>% 
  mutate(day = ???) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=day, y=sentiment)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

- Which tweeter is the most positive? negative?
- Is there a day that spirits were higher in the tweets? Or when tweets were more negative?
- Does the tweeter `aflratings` have a trend in positivity or negativity?
