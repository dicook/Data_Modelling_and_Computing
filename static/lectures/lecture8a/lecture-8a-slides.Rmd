# Why text analysis?

.huge[
- To use the realtors text description to improve the Melbourne housing price model
- Determine the extent of public discontent with train stoppages in Melbourne
- The differences between Darwin's first edition of the Origin of the Species and the 6th edition
- Does the sentiment of posts on Newcastle Jets public facebook page reflect their win/los record?

# Typical Process

.huge[
1. Read in text
2. Pre-processing: remove punctuation signs, remove numbers, stop words, stem words
3. Tokenise: words, sentences, ngrams, chapters
4. Summarise
5. model
