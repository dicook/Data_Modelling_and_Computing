# Assignment notes

.huge[
- Some questions might seem a bit strange - this is normal! 
- Sometimes you can't answer the exact question with the data you have. - It might be frustrating, but **rest assured** that for the question about combining the crime data with income data, there is no "trick" - the data isn't perfect here. 
- Describe how you think the solution you have provided helps answer the question, show us a plot, and describe what sort of other information you might like to try and have, or what you think we can learn.

# Learning technique: study

--

.huge[
1. Practice previous exam in exam conditions
2. Think up exam questions, write them down
3. Practice explaining concepts - either out aloud by yourself, in the mirror, to a friend, to an empty room. Saying things out aloud builds better connections.
]

---
class: bg-main5

# Learning technique: in exam

--

.huge[
1. Peruse the exam before starting
2. Take off one shoe (If you like - my high school teacher claimed this worked, and I did it.)
3. Number questions in order from easy-hard - start with the easiest one first
4. Work out a marks : minutes ratio. (e.g., if there are 60 marks, and 60 minutes, then it's one mark per minute of time spent.)

# Recap on some tricky topics

.huge[
- assignment ("gets" - `<-`)
- pipes (from the textbook)
]

---
class: bg-main1

# The pipe operator: `%>%`

.pull-left.huge[
- Code to tell a story about a little bunny foo foo (borrowed from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html):
- Using functions for each verb: `hop()`, `scoop()`, `bop()`.

]
.pull-right.huge[
> Little bunny Foo Foo
Went hopping through the forest
Scooping up the field mice
And bopping them on the head
]

---
class: bg-main1

# Approach: Intermediate steps

.huge[
```r
foo_foo_1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo_2 <- scoop(foo_foo_1, up = field_mice)
foo_foo_3 <- bop(foo_foo_2, on = head)
```
]

--

.huge[
- Main downside: forces you to name each intermediate element. 
- Sometimes these steps form natural names. If this is the case - go ahead.
- **But many times there are not natural names**
- Adding number suffixes to make the names unique leads to problems. 
]

---
class: bg-main1

# Approach: Intermediate steps

.huge[
```r
foo_foo_1 <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo_2 <- scoop(foo_foo_1, up = field_mice)
foo_foo_3 <- bop(foo_foo_2, on = head)
```
]

--

.huge[

- Code is cluttered with unimportant names
- Suffix has to be carefully incremented on each line.
- I've done this. 99% of the time I mess a number somewhere and spend the rest
of the night debugging my code.
]

---
class: bg-main1

# Another Approach: Overwrite the original

.huge[
```r
foo_foo <- hop(foo_foo, through = forest)
foo_foo <- scoop(foo_foo, up = field_mice)
foo_foo <- bop(foo_foo, on = head)
```
]

--

.huge[
- Overwrite originals instead of creating intermediate objects 
- Less typing (and less thinking). Less likely to make mistakes?
- **Painful debugging**: need to re-run the code from the top.
- Repitition of object - (`foo_foo` written 6 times!) Obscures what changes.
]


---
class: bg-main1

# (Yet) Another approach: function composition

.huge[
```r
bop(
  scoop(
    hop(foo_foo, through = forest),
    up = field_mice
  ), 
  on = head
)
```
]

--

.huge[
- You need to read inside-out, and right-to-left.
- Arguments are spread far apart
- Harder to read
]

class: bg-main1

# Pipe `%>%` can help!

.huge.pull-left[
`f(x)` 

`g(f(x))`

`h(g(f(x)))`
]

.vlarge.pull-right[
`x %>% f()`

`x %>% f() %>% g()`

`x %>% f() %>% g() %>% h()`
]

---
class: bg-main1

# Solution: Use the pipe - `%>%`

.huge[

```r
foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```

]

.huge[

- focusses on verbs, not nouns. 
- Can be read as a series of function compositions like actions.

# Why look at audio data?

.huge[
- Data comes in many shapes and sizes
- A lot of data is available in html tables on web sites. 
- Extracting the data from these tables is called "web scraping". 
]

---


# Scraping the web: what? why?

.huge[
- Increasing amount of data is available on the web.
- These data are provided in an unstructured format: you can always copy&paste, but it's 
time-consuming and prone to errors.
- Web scraping is the process of extracting this information automatically and transform it into 
a structured dataset.
]

---

# Scraping the web: what? why?

.huge[
1. Screen scraping: extract data from source code of website, with html parser (easy) or regular expression matching (less easy).
2. Web APIs (application programming interface): website offers a set of structured http  requests that return JSON or XML files.
- Why R? It includes all tools necessary to do web scraping, familiarity, direct analysis of data... But python, perl, java are also efficient tools.
]

---
class: bg-main1
# Web Scraping with rvest

---
class: bg-main1
# Hypertext Markup Language

.huge[
Most of the data on the web is still largely available as HTML - while it is structured (hierarchical / tree based) it often is not available in a form useful for analysis (flat / tidy).
]

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>This is a title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p align="center">Hello world!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

# rvest: Simplifies processing and manipulating HTML data

.huge[
- `read_html` - read HTML data from a url or character string.
- `html_nodes` - select specified nodes from the HTML document using CSS selectors.
- `html_table` - parse an HTML table into a data frame.
- `html_text` - extract tag pairs' content.
- `paths_allowed()` - from `robotstxt`, tells you if you can scrape something, legally.

# SelectorGadget: css selectors

.vlarge[
- Using a tool called selector gadget to **help** identify the html elements of interest
- Does this by constructing a css selector which can be used to subset the html document.

Selector          |  Example         |     Description
------------      |------------------|      ------------------------------------------------
element           |  `p`             |      Select all &lt;p&gt; elements
element element   |  `div p`         |      Select all &lt;p&gt; elements inside a &lt;div&gt; element          
element>element   |  `div > p`       |      Select all &lt;p&gt; elements with &lt;div&gt; as a parent
.class            |  `.title`        |      Select all elements with class="title"
\#id              |  `.name`         |      Select all elements with id="name"
[attribute]       |  `[class]`       |      Select all elements with a class attribute
[attribute=value] |  `[class=title]` |      Select all elements with class="title"

# SelectorGadget

.vlarge[
- SelectorGadget: Open source tool that eases CSS selector generation and discovery
- Install the [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb) 
- A box will open in the bottom right of the website. Click on a page element 
that you would like your selector to match (it will turn green). SelectorGadget 
will then generate a minimal CSS selector for that element, and will highlight 
(yellow) everything that is 
matched by the selector. 
- Now click on a highlighted element to remove it from the selector (red), or 
click on an unhighlighted element to add it to the selector. Through this process 
of selection and rejection, SelectorGadget helps you come up with the appropriate 
CSS selector for your needs.
