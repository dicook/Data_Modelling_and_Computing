  - (pull examples from exercise)
- short exercise in class to calculate correlation and r2 and answer questions
  
- unpacking lm and model objects
- augment?
- why are making day0
- understanding residuals

- Briefly show the examples of AIC, BIC, Deviance
  - These are evidence to make a decision
  - Just so they have notes on how to interpret these (higher/lower is better?)

# Feedback from assignment 1

.vlarge[
- Some students forgot to answer some of the questions: "Is there anything else in the excel spreadsheet we could look at?".
- Some groups need to follow Amelia's three-sentence interpretation to describe plots.
- For the last questions, I (Sherry) expect people to also talks about how the analysis would help with the business.

Presentation & grammar:
- Remember to do a spell check before submitting any of your files
- Don't need install.package in your Rmd library() is enough

# definition of correlation

For two variables $X, Y$, correlation is:

$$r=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}} = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{s_xs_y}$$

# What is $R^2$?

.huge[
- (model variance)/(total variance), the amount of variance in response explained by the model. 
- Always ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. 
- Adding more variables to the model will always increase $R^2$, so what is important is how big an increase is gained. - Adjusted $R^2$ reduces this for every additional variable added.

# AIC, BIC, Deviance

  - AIC, BIC, and Deviance are evidence to make a decision

- Deviance is the residual variation, how much variation in response that IS NOT explained by the model. The close to 0 the better, but it is not on a standard scale. In comparing two models if one has substantially lower deviance, then it is a better model.
- Similarly BIC (Bayes Information Criterion) indicates how well the model fits, best used to compare two models. The lower is better.
- df is the degrees of freedom left from the model fit. Starts at $n$ (sample size) and drops for each additional parameter estimated by the model. 

All of these statistics indicate the model 2 is substantially a better fit than model 1.

# Gapminder

- Hans Rosling was a Swedish doctor, academic and statistician, Professor of International Health at Karolinska Institute. Sadley he passed away in 2017. - He developed a keen interest in health and wealth across the globe, and the relationship with other factors like agriculture, education, energy. 
- His presentations on data are amazing! A starting place is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo.

# many models
  - gapminder
  - fit with year
    - recenter year to be from 1950
    - fit again (ask a quiz question about this)
  - What is the average life expectancy?
  - What if we want to fit a separate model for each country? Can we fit a linear model for each country?
- why are making day0
- why are we standardization



Open the app available at [https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/SSregression/](https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/SSregression/). (The original version was obtained from [https://github.com/paternogbc/SSregression](https://github.com/paternogbc/SSregression), developed by Gustavo Brant Paterno, a PhD student from Brazil.)

The app simulates some data using different slopes and error variance. It allows you to see how characteristics of the data affect model summaries. Time to play!

1. Vary the slope from high positive to zero. What happens to the error variance? The total variance and the regression variance (due to model)? Does the proportion of variation of each component change? How? Is this the same if you vary from large negative slope to zero?
2. Holding the slope fixed at 1, increase the standard deviation of the error model. What happens to components of variation?
3. As the slope changes, what happens to the intercept?
4. Why isn't the estimated slope the same as what is set by the slider?

```{r variance, echo=FALSE, eval = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Which following is the `total variation`?",
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and fitted values."),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between observed response and average response.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("The sum of squared difference between fitted response and average response.")),
  
  question("Which following is the `model variation`?",
