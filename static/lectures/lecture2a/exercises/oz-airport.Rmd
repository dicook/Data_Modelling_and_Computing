First we read in the data from the excel sheet
```{r read-passengers}
library(readxl)
passengers <- read_xls(path = "data/WebAirport_FY_1986-2017.xls", 
                       sheet = 3, 
                       skip = 6)
passengers
```

Tidy the data, to produce a data set with these columns
    - airport: all of the airports. 
    - year 
    - type_of_flight: DOMESTIC, INTERNATIONAL
    - bound: IN or OUT
    


```{r extension exercise}
tidy_passengers <- passengers %>%
  select(-...1, 
         -...14, 
         -Rank, 
         -starts_with("TOTAL")) %>%
  rename(
    INBOUND_DOM = ___,
    INBOUND_INTL = ___,
    OUTBOUND_DOM = ___,
    OUTBOUND_INTL = ___,
    INBOUND_TOTL = ___,
    OUTBOUND_TOTL =___
  ) %>%
  gather(key = where, 
         value = amount, 
         starts_with("IN"), 
         starts_with("OUT"))
```
