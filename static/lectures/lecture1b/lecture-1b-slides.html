# R essentials: A short list (for now)

.large.white[
- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:
]


```r
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

.large.white[
- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:
]


```r
dataframe$var_name
```

--

.large.white[
- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:
]

```r
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

# Today: Outline

.huge[
* Why we care about Reproducibility
* R + markdown = Rmarkdown 
* Controling output and input of rmarkdown

How do I create a code chunk?
What sort of options to I need to worry about for my code?
What is the value in a reproducible report?
What is markdown?
Can I combine my software and my writing?

.vvhuge[
So what can we do about it?
]

---

# Reproducibility checklist

.huge[
Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

]

---

# Reproducibility checklist

.huge[
Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?

# Literate programming is a partial solution

.huge[
* Literate programming shines some light on this dark area of science. 

* This is an idea from [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) where you combine your text with your code output to create a document. 

* This is a _blend_ of your literature (**text**), and your programming (**code**), to create something that you can read from top to bottom. 
]

---

.huge[
So
]

--

.huge[

Imagine a report:

Introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion,

]

--

.huge[
and all the bits of code that make each section. 
]

.huge[

With rmarkdown, you can see all the pieces of your data analysis all together.

Each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

* Q: How do we take `markdown` + `R code` = "literate programming environment"

* A: `Rmarkdown` 
]

---

# Rmarkdown...

--

.huge[
Provides an environment where you can write your complete analysis, and marries your text, and code together into a rich document. 
]

--

.huge[
You write your code as code chunks, put your text around that, and then hey presto, you have a document you can reproduce.
]

---

# Reminder: You've already used rmarkdown!

---

# How will we use R Markdown?

.huge[
- Every assignment + project /  is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
- These lecture notes are created using R Markdown
]

---

# The anatomy of an rmarkdown document

.huge[
There are three parts to an rmarkdown document.

* Metadata (YAML)
* Text (markdown formatting)
* Code (code formatting)
]

--

.vvhuge.center[DEMO]

---
class: bg-main1

# Metadata: YAML

.huge[
* The metadata of the document tells you how it is formed - what the **title** is, what **date** to put, and other control information.  

* If you're familiar with `\(\LaTeX\)`, this is kind of like how you specify the many options, what sort of document it is, what styles to use, etc in the front matter.

]

---
class: bg-main1

# Metadata: YAML

.huge[
* Rmarkdown documents use YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) to provide the metadata. It looks like this:

```YAML
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Nicholas Tierney"
output: html_document
---
```

It starts an ends with three dashes `---`, and has fields like the following: `title`, `author`, and `output`.

]

---
class: bg-main1
# Text

.huge[
Is markdown, as we discussed in the earlier section,

It provides a simple way to mark up text

]

.pull-left.huge[

```
1. bullet list
2. bullet list
3. bullet list
```

]

.pull-right.huge[

1. bullet list
1. bullet list
1. bullet list

]

---

# Code

.vhuge[
We refer to code in an rmarkdown document in two ways:

1. Code chunks, and 
2. Inline code.
]

---

# Code: Code chunks

.huge[
`Code chunks` are marked by three backticks and curly braces with `r` inside them:

````markdown
```{r chunk-name}
# a code chunk
```
````

]

---
class: bg-main1 

.huge[
**a backtick** is a special character you might not have seen before, it is typically located under the tilde key (`~`). On USA / Australia keyboards, is under the escape key:


&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://njtierney.updog.co/img/ansi-keyboard.png" alt="image from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ANSI_Keyboard_Layout_Diagram_with_Form_Factor.svg" width="80%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;image from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ANSI_Keyboard_Layout_Diagram_with_Form_Factor.svg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
]

---

# Code: Inline code

.huge[
Sometimes you want to run the code inside a sentence. When the code is run inside the sentence, it is called running the code "inline".

You might want to run the code inline to name the number of variables or rows in a dataset in a sentence like:

&gt; There are XXX observations in the airquality dataset, and XXX variables.
]

---

# Code: Inline code

.huge[
You can call code "inline"  like so:

````markdown

There are `r nrow(airquality) ` observations in the airquality dataset, 
and `r 'ncol(airquality) ` variables.

````

Which gives you the following sentence
]

--

.huge[

&gt; There are 153 observations in the airquality dataset, and 6 variables.

What's great about this is that if your data changes upstream, then you don't need to work out where you mentioned your data, you just update the document.
]
 
---
class: bg-main1
# Your Turn: Put it together

.huge[
Go to `rstudio.cloud` and 

* knitr the document " .Rmd"
* Change the data section at the top to be ..
* knit the document again
* How the text in the document changes
]

<div class="countdown" id="timer_5d43207d" style="right:0;bottom:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">05</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>

---
# Code: Chunk names

.huge[
Straight after the ` ```{r ` you can use a text string to name the chunk. This has three advantages:

1. Navigate to specific chunks using the drop-down code navigator in the bottom-left of the script editor.
2. Graphics produced by chunks now have useful names.
3. You can set up networks of cached chunks to avoid re-performing expensive computations on every run.
]

---
# Code: Chunk names

.huge[
- Every chunk should ideally have a name.
- Naming things is hard, but follow these rules and you'll be fine:

* one word that describes the action (e.g., "read")
* one word that describes the thing inside the code (e.g, "gapminder")
* separate words with "-" (e.g., `read-gapminder`)
]

---
# Code: Chunk options

.huge[
You can control how the code is output by changing the code chunk options which follow the title. 
]

````markdown
```{r read-gapminder, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
gap &lt;- read_csv("gapminder.csv")
```
````

-- 

.huge[
What do you think this does?
]

<div class="countdown" id="timer_5d43219d" style="right:0;bottom:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">00</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">30</span></code>
</div>


---
# Code: Chunk options

.vlarge[
The code chunk options you need to know about right now are:

  * `cache`: TRUE / FALSE. Do you want to save the output of the chunk so it doesn't have to run next time?
  * `eval`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to evaluate the code?
  * `echo`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to print the code?
  * `include`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to include code output in the final output document? Setting to `FALSE` means nothing is put into the output document, but the code is still run.
]

.large[
You can read more about the options at the official documentation: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#code-evaluation
]

---
# Your turn

.huge[
* go to `rstudio.cloud`, open document `` and change the document so that the code output is hidden, the graphics are shown, 
* This should match the "final.Rmd" document.
* Take a look at the [R Markdown Gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html).
]


<div class="countdown" id="timer_5d4321d5" style="right:0;bottom:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">05</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>

---

# Global options: Set and forget

.huge[
You can set the default chunk behaviour once at the top of the `.Rmd` file using a chunk like:

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  cache = TRUE
)
```

then you will only need to add chunk options when you have the occasional one that you'd like to behave differently.
]
---

# Your turn

.huge[
Go to `rstudio.cloud` and change the global settings at the top of the rmarkdown document to `echo = FALSE`, and `cache = TRUE`, and update the other code chunks.
]

<div class="countdown" id="timer_5d4322f2" style="right:0;bottom:0;" data-warnwhen="0">
<code class="countdown-time"><span class="countdown-digits minutes">03</span><span class="countdown-digits colon">:</span><span class="countdown-digits seconds">00</span></code>
</div>

---
class: bg-main1

# Your turn: Different types of documents 

.huge[
1. Change the output of your current R Markdown file to produce a **Word document**. Now try to produce pdf - this may not work! That's OK, we do'nt need it right now.
2. Create a new document that will produce a slide show `File &gt; New R Markdown &gt; Presentation`
3. Create a flexdashboard document - see this option in the `File &gt; New R Markdown &gt; From template` list.

We are going to set up the groups for doing assignment work.

1. Choose a quote from the bag. 
2. Find the other people in the class with the same quote as you
3. Grab your gear and claim a table to work together at.
