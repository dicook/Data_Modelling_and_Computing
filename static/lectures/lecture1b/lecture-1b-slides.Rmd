# R essentials: A short list (for now)

.large.white[
- Functions are (most often) verbs, followed by what they will be applied to in parentheses:
]

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
do_this(to_this)
do_that(to_this, to_that, with_those)
```

--

.large.white[
- Columns (variables) in data frames are accessed with `$`:
]

```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
dataframe$var_name
```

--

.large.white[
- Packages are installed with the `install.packages` function and loaded with the `library` function, once per session:
]
```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("package_name")
library(package_name)
```

So what can we do about it?
]

---

# Reproducibility checklist

.huge[
Near-term goals:

- Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?
- Does the code actually do what you think it does?
- In addition to what was done, is it clear **why** it was done? 
(e.g., how were parameter settings chosen?)

]

---

# Reproducibility checklist

.huge[
Long-term goals:

- Can the code be used for other data?
- Can you extend the code to do other things?
]

# Literate programming is a partial solution

.huge[
* Literate programming shines some light on this dark area of science. 

* An idea from [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) where you combine your text with your code output to create a document. 

* A _blend_ of your literature (**text**), and your programming (**code**), to create something you can read from top to bottom. 
]

.huge[
So
]

--

.huge[

Imagine a report:

Introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion,

]

--

.huge[
and all the bits of code that make each section. 
]

.huge[

With rmarkdown, you can see all the pieces of your data analysis all together.

Each time you knit the analysis is ran from the beginning

* Q: How do we take `markdown` + `R code` = "literate programming environment"

* A: `Rmarkdown` 
]

---

# Rmarkdown...

--

.huge[
Provides an environment where you can write your complete analysis, and marries your text, and code together into a rich document. 
]

--

.huge[
You write your code as code chunks, put your text around that, and then hey presto, you have a document you can reproduce.

# How will we use R Markdown?

.huge[
- Every assignment + project /  is an R Markdown document
- You'll always have a template R Markdown document to start with
- The amount of scaffolding in the template will decrease over the semester
- These lecture notes are created using R Markdown (!)
]

# The anatomy of an rmarkdown document

.huge[
There are three parts to an rmarkdown document.

* Metadata (YAML)
* Text (markdown formatting)
* Code (code formatting)
]

--

.vvhuge.center[DEMO]

---
class: bg-main1

# Metadata: YAML  (YAML Ain't Markup Language) 

.huge[
* The metadata of the document tells you how it is formed - what the **title** is, what **date** to put, and other control information.  

* If you're familiar with $\LaTeX$, this is ksimilar to how you specify document type, styles, fonts, options, etc in the front matter / preamble.

]

---
class: bg-main1

# Metadata: YAML

.huge[
* Rmarkdown documents use YAML to provide the metadata. It looks like this:

```YAML
---
title: "An example document"
author: "Nicholas Tierney"
output: html_document
---
```

It starts an ends with three dashes `---`, and has fields like the following: `title`, `author`, and `output`.

]

---
class: bg-main1
# Text

.huge[
Is markdown, as we discussed in the earlier section,

It provides a simple way to mark up text

]

.pull-left.huge[

```
1. bullet list
2. bullet list
3. bullet list
```

]

.pull-right.huge[

1. bullet list
1. bullet list
1. bullet list

]

---

# Code

.vhuge[
We refer to code in an rmarkdown document in two ways:

1. Code chunks, and 
2. Inline code.
]

---

# Code: Code chunks

.huge[
`Code chunks` are marked by three backticks and curly braces with `r` inside them:

````markdown
```{r chunk-name}`r ''`
# a code chunk
```
````

]

---
class: bg-main1 

.huge[
**a backtick** is a special character you might not have seen before, it is typically located under the tilde key (`~`). On USA / Australia keyboards, is under the escape key:


```{r show-backtick, out.width = "80%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "image from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ANSI_Keyboard_Layout_Diagram_with_Form_Factor.svg"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://njtierney.updog.co/img/ansi-keyboard.png")
```
]

---

# Code: Inline code

.huge[
Sometimes you want to run the code inside a sentence. This is called running the code "inline".
]

--

.huge[
You might want to run the code inline to name the number of variables or rows in a dataset in a sentence like:

> There are XXX observations in the airquality dataset, and XXX variables.

]

---

# Code: Inline code

.huge[
You can call code "inline"  like so:

````markdown

There are `r "\u0060r nrow(airquality) \u0060"` observations in the airquality dataset, 
and `r "\u0060r ncol(airquality) \u0060"` variables.

````

Which gives you the following sentence
]

--

.huge[

> There are `r nrow(airquality)` observations in the airquality dataset, and `r ncol(airquality)` variables.

]

---


# Code: Inline code


.huge[
What's great about this is that if your data changes upstream, then you don't need to work out where you mentioned your data, you just update the document.
]
 
---
class: bg-main1
# Your Turn: Put it together

.huge[
Go to `rstudio.cloud` and 

* open the document "01-oz-atlas.Rmd"
* knit the document 
* Change the data section at the top to be from a different state instead of "New South Wales"
* knit the document again
* How do the text and figures in the document change?

# Code: Chunk names

.huge[
Straight after the ` ```{r ` you can use a text string to name the chunk:

` ```{r read-crime-data} `
]

````markdown
```{r read-crime-data}`r ''`
crime <- read_csv("data/crime-data.csv")
```
````

---
class: bg-main1

# Code: Chunk Names

.huge[
Naming code chunks has three advantages:

1. Navigate to specific chunks using the drop-down code navigator in the bottom-left of the script editor.
2. Graphics produced by chunks now have useful names.
3. You can set up networks of cached chunks to avoid re-performing expensive computations on every run.
]

---
# Code: Chunk names

.huge[
- Every chunk should ideally have a name.
- Naming things is hard, but follow these rules and you'll be fine:

1. One word that describes the action (e.g., "read")
2. One word that describes the thing inside the code (e.g, "gapminder")
3. Separate words with "-" (e.g., `read-gapminder`)
]

---
# Code: Chunk options

.huge[
You can control how the code is output by changing the code chunk options which follow the title. 
]

````markdown
```{r read-gapminder, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}`r ''`
gap <- read_csv("gapminder.csv")
```
````

.huge[
What do you think this does?
]

```{r}
countdown(minutes = 0, seconds = 30)
```


---
class: bg-main1

# Code: Chunk options

.vlarge[
The code chunk options you need to know about right now are:

  * `cache`: TRUE / FALSE. Do you want to save the output of the chunk so it doesn't have to run next time?
  * `eval`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to evaluate the code?
  * `echo`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to print the code?
  * `include`: TRUE / FALSE Do you want to include code output in the final output document? Setting to `FALSE` means nothing is put into the output document, but the code is still run.
]

.large[
You can read more about the options at the official documentation: https://yihui.name/knitr/options/#code-evaluation
]

---
# Your turn

.huge[
* go to `rstudio.cloud`, open document `01-oz-atlas.Rmd` and change the document so that the code output is hidden, but the graphics are shown. (Hint: Google "rstudio rmarkdown cheatsheet" for some tips!)
* Re-Knit the document.
* Take a look at the [R Markdown Gallery](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/gallery.html).
]


```{r cdown-rmd-chunk-opts}
countdown(minutes = 5)
```

---

# Global options: Set and forget

.huge[
You can set the default chunk behaviour once at the top of the `.Rmd` file using a chunk like:

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  cache = TRUE
)
```

then you will only need to add chunk options when you have the occasional one that you'd like to behave differently.
]
---
class: bg-main1

# Your turn

.huge[
* Go to your `01-oz-atlas.Rmd` document on `rstudio.cloud` and change the global settings at the top of the rmarkdown document to `echo = FALSE`, and `cache = TRUE`
* Update the other code chunks by removing the code chunk options.
]
