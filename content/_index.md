## MoVE

Borrow a laptop:
If you are enrolled in a MoVE unit and forget your laptop, or do not own one as yet, please visit **Monash Connect** to borrow a laptop for an activity or part of a day:

**Clayton: 7.45AM - 5PM**

You may be required to provide proof of ID (student card or personal ID) in order to borrow a laptop. 
We have a limited amount of laptops available for students to borrow (during semester only). Collect an IT Services ticket when you go to Monash Connect.

*We will use the rstudio cloud server. In the future we may have R and Rstudio installed locally. When this happens, you can use USB stick, attach to the borrowed laptop, and install R, RStudio and all your packages on this. Use can then use the USB stick as your working environment, with the borrowed laptop simply as the computing engine.*

## Project

[Project instructions](project/project-instructions.html) 

- **Deadline 1 (13th September)**:  Find team members, and potential topics to study (List of groups will be posted here)
- **Deadline 2 (20th September)**:  Team members and team name, data description.
- **Deadline 3 **:  Electronic copy of your data, and a page of data description, and cleaning done, or needing to be done.
