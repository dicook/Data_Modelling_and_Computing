# ETC1010: Data Modelling and Computing

## Semester 1 2019

- Lecturers: Professor Di Cook (dicook@monash.edu)
- Tutors: Stuart Lee, Steph Kobakian, Mitchell O'Hara-Wild

Unless your question is a personal issue or an administrative matter, please do not send us direct email. The [ED site](https://edstem.org/courses/3443/) is appropriate for questions related to the course material.

## Schedule

- Lectorials: Tue 4:00-5:40; Thu 10:00-11:40 (101 - LTB Bldg 92)
- Note: ED is used for asking for help, reading and lab exercise quizzes and assignment turn in. Only your name and email is stored in this system.
- **If you register after the start of the semester** or if you
  miss a lecture/lab, it is your responsibility to catch up with
  missed material, learn about due dates for material to be turned in,
  and getting assigned to a group for team work.
  
## Consultation times

## MoVE

If you are enrolled in a MoVE unit and forget your laptop, or do not own one as yet, please visit the locations below to borrow a laptop for an activity or part of a day:
Clayton: Room 2.24 - Level 2, Learning and Teaching Building. You’re required to provide proof of ID (student card or personal ID) in order to borrow a laptop. This service is open from 7.45am - 7.00pm on Monday to Friday.

*Access to R is through a server. We have found that this was a slow way to work. The most successful approach is to have a USB stick, attach to the borrowed laptop, and install R, RStudio and all your packages on this. Use this as your working environment, with the borrowed laptop simply as the computing engine.*
